# Docker Centos

A docker container preloaded with CentOS OS (CentOS 7).

To use, just build the docker image

To build the image:

docker build --tag [your repo]/[image name] .
To run the container:

docker run -p 8080:8080 -d [your repo]/[image name]

Can use image as a base for other applications that runs on Unix/Linux environments.

In your __Dockerfile__ (first line)

```
FROM [your repo]/[image name]
```

ideally, you would have built your image and uploaded to a Docker Registry (either a private hosted docker registry or Docker Hub).
